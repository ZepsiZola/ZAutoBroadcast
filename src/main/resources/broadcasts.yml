# This file is used to configure the broadcasts that are sent to the players.

# The messages use MiniMessage format and any PlaceholderAPI placeholders.
# Refer to https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html for more information on MiniMessage format.

##### IMPORTANT ##### MUST READ #####
# There is no use of & for color codes, instead, use <color>.
# You need to have the PlaceholderAPI plugin installed for the placeholders to work.
##### IMPORTANT ##### MUST READ #####

# The "weight" field defines how often the broadcast will show.
# For example, if one broadcast has a weight of 10 while the others have a weight of 1, then that broadcast will appear 10 times as often as the others.

# Feel free to delete these example messages and add your own.
